Welcome to the "Sales Analysis of Electronic Data" project! This repository contains data, code, and visualizations related to the analysis of electronic sales data. I've used Jupyter Notebook to perform the analysis and generate various plots and insights.

## Project Overview

In this project, I analyze sales data of electronic products to gain valuable insights and make data-driven decisions. I have explore the dataset, perform data cleaning, and create visualizations to uncover trends and patterns. The analysis includes but is not limited to:

- Monthly and yearly sales trends.
- Top-selling products and categories.
- Customer segmentation.
- Profitability analysis.

## Project Contents

The repository is organized as follows:
